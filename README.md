# Axe_Game
project for a course from gamedev.tv


Its a simple project made for a course from gamedev.tv
Just run the EXE file to play, or the main-code-workspace to view the code

You play as the blue circle, you can move only left and right.
You cant win the game, you can only lose when the axe(red rectanlge) hits you.
